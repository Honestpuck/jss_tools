"""python-jss

Python wrapper for the JAMF Casper JSS API.

"import jss" to import all public classes.

Public package contents include:
    casper: Class using the Casper private API call to casper.jxml.
    distribution_point: Classes for AFP, SMB, CDP, and JDS DPs.
    distribution_points: Class for managing distribution point classes.
        distribution points, JDS, and CDP distribution servers, and
        copying, deleting, and testing for files, as well as a
        controller class for abstracting all configured DPs.
    exceptions: python-jss custom exceptions.
    jamf_software_server: Class for representing a JSS, and for
        preference files to configure one.
    jssobject: Base class used for JSS objects. Useful for testing
        (e.g. "isinstance(obj, JSSObject)").
    jssobjects: Represents each of the objects the JSS supports
        (packages, computers, etc).
    jss_prefs: Class for loading python-jss configuration via a plist
        file, and for use as an argument to JSS. Includes an
        interactive setup helper.

Private package contents include:
    contrib: Code from other authors used in python-jss.
    jssobjectlist: Classes for representing lists of objects returned
        from the JSS' GET searches.
    tlsadapter: Adapter to allow python HTTP requests to use TLS, and
        with the correct ciphers to match current JAMF recommendations.
    tools: Assorted functions for common tasks used throughout the
        package.
